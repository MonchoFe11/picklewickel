            We're building a pickleball app that actually makes sense. Go figure...

            PickleWickel is in <span className="font-bold text-muted-green">BETA mode</span>, which is fancy tech speak for "it's kinda working, but also kinda not." Some days you'll pull up the app and see every tournament score perfectly laid out like a work of art. Other days? You might see tumbleweeds. ðŸŒµ
          </p>
          <p className="text-onSurface/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The app might look different every time you open it because we're basically redesigning it in real-time based on what makes sense (and what doesn't make us want to throw our phones).

            Because we're not some corporate suits in a boardroom guessing what pickleball players want. We're actual players who've been dinked into oblivion and know the pain of trying to find tournament scores on sketchy websites that look like they were built in 2003.

            We could build this thing in a vacuum and hope for the best, OR we could have awesome players like you tell us when we're being brilliant vs. when we're being complete disasters.

          <p className="text-onSurface/80 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            One day (soon), PickleWickel will be the app that makes checking pickleball scores as addictive as scrolling through that other pickleball app that bombards you with ads just so you can validate your existence and measure yourself against other players. Until then, we're your friendly neighborhood beta testers who accidentally made an app.
